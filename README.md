## Configuration

The plugin requires latitude,longitude, and optionally altitude measurements provided as floats in two/three separate fields
formatted by Grafana as a "Time series".

It can be used with MySQL/MariaDB as a data source by using 2/3 queries along the lines of:
```
A: SELECT "latitude" as value, $__time(timestamp) FROM "location" WHERE $__timeFilter(timestamp) ORDER BY timestamp ASC
B: SELECT "longitude" as value, $__time(timestamp) FROM "location" WHERE $__timeFilter(timestamp) ORDER BY timestamp ASC
B: SELECT "altitude" as value, $__time(timestamp) FROM "location" WHERE $__timeFilter(timestamp) ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

## How to develop
If you donâ€™t want to install Grafana on your local machine, you can use Docker.

To set up Grafana for plugin development using Docker, run the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)"/dist:/var/lib/grafana/plugins --name=grafana grafana/grafana:7.0.0
```

Since Grafana only loads plugins on start-up, you need to restart the container whenever you add or remove a plugin.

```
docker restart grafana
```
