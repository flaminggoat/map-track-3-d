# MapTrack3D

A plugin for Grafana that visualizes GPS points on a 3D globe. A marker shows the position at the time when hovering over other panels on the dashboard.

## Configuration

The plugin requires latitude,longitude, and optionally altitude measurements provided as floats in two/three separate fields
formatted by Grafana as a "Time series".

It can be used with MySQL/MariaDB as a data source by using 2/3 queries along the lines of:

```
SELECT
    "timestamp" as time,
    lat,
    lon,
    alt,
FROM test_data
WHERE $__timeFilter(timestamp)
ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

A demo CSV file that can be used in conjunction with [CSV datasource](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-csv-datasource/) is provided at [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flaminggoat/map-track-3-d/master/testdata/iss.csv)

## How to develop
If you donâ€™t want to install Grafana on your local machine, you can use Docker.

To set up Grafana for plugin development using Docker, run the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)"/dist:/var/lib/grafana/plugins --name=grafana grafana/grafana:7.4.3
```

Since Grafana only loads plugins on start-up, you need to restart the container whenever you add or remove a plugin.

```
docker restart grafana
```
